    "\n",
    "Why we use Numpy - in python we have listss that server the purpose of arrays, however are slow to proecss - Numpy aims to providig an array object that is 50 times faster than traditional python lists and is more efficient !!! NumPy arrays are store in one continous place in memory and Numpy lists are optimezed to work with the latest CPU achitectures.\n",
