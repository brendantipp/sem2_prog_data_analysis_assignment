# sem2_prog_data_analysis_assignment
Programming for Data Analysis Assignment - Semester 2


#### Tasks for this assignment 

1. Explain the overall purpose of teh numpy.random package
2. Explain the use of the "simple random data" and "Permutations" functions
3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five "Distribution" fucntions
4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers

#### Create project/assignment plan

Jupyter Notebook created named - explaining.numpy.random

My Assignment Plan 

Explain purpose package 

Use the reamde file to give an overview of the package and withing Jupyter i will dig deeper into how to load numpy and some examples of using the subpackage.

I intend to use this section to expalin more about the newest version of of numpy and the main changes. I will give an overview of the main chalenges software developers face when packages and APIs are upadted with examples 

Explain the use of the "simple random data" and "Permutations" functions

Within the readme i will exmplain the uses and withing the jupyter file will dig deeper with examples and sample code 

Explain the use and purpose of at least five "Distribution" fucntions

Use the reamde to give a brief desciption of each of the selected distibutions, i will use jupyter to code exmaples of how each can be used. I will genrate random data using numpy and i will graph my restults for visual representation.

Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers
 
Withing the readme file give an overvie of seeds, why they are important, there usess and withing the Jupyter notebook give examples of how they are used, im going to review and reshearch how the PCG64 method outperforms the mersenne twister pseudo random number monthod from the previous version of Numpy
